# Flight_Controller
The code used on my STM32 diy drone flight controller

## Installation and running
Download and add the repository https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/Arduino_STM32 to devices folder within the Arduino IDE folder to access the boards hardware settings.
With this done one can use the Arduino IDE to upload the code directly to the board.
